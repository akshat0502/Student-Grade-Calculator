<h1>Student Grade Calculator Project </h1>
<br>
For a <b>Student Grade Calculator Project </b>built using <b>Java</b>, the objective is to create a program that calculates and displays the final grades for students based on their scores in various subjects. The project will allow the user (e.g., a teacher or student) to input scores for different subjects, calculate the average or total, and assign a grade based on predefined grading criteria.

  <li><h3>Java Classes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>GradeCalculator</b> – 
        <ul>
          <li>Contains the logic for calculating the total score, average, and final grade based on the scores.</li>
          <li>Represents the student’s information such as name and subject scores.</li>
          <li>The entry point for the program, handling the user interaction (input/output) and using the GradeCalculator to compute grades.</li>

<h2>Project Files Overview:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>GradeCalculator: </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Contains the logic for calculating the total marks, average score, and grade.</li>
      <li>Based on the average score, it assigns a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
      </li>
      <li>Passes the data to the GradeCalculator and outputs the calculated grade.</li>
    </ul>
